My First Grails application

This application is made based off of tutorials I am reading online about working with grails.

The application is very basic so far.  At the moment it works as a racetrack registration web app.
Its purpose is to allow the user to create a race, a runner and registration.  

The versions for this application are as follows:
* Grails 3.3.6
* Groovy 2.4.15
* JVM 1.8.0_66
